# moral_alignment_quiz
Originating from Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) fantasy role-playing game, moral alignments were used to define the ethical and moral inclination of characters on two axes: ethic and moral. This would prevent characters from acting randomly. The ethical axis (lawful, neutral, and chaotic) defines how one interacts with structure. A lawful character values rules and order while a chaotic one freedom and adaptability. The moral axis (good, neutral, good) defines how a character interact with other parties. A good character is driven by principle and common good while an evil character focuses on self advancement and survival.

This quiz will predict your likely moral alignment based on questions about your lifestyle and wellbeing.
